# UHI
Urban Heat Island (UHI) Temperature Prediction  This project uses machine learning models like Random Forest, LSTM, SVR, and XGBoost to predict urban temperatures based on geospatial features such as NDVI, LST, UHI, and UTFVI. It aims to analyze and forecast the impact of Urban Heat Islands in city environments.
